## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

In addition to the standard Anaconda distribution of Python, you will need to install the following libraries.
1. plotly 

This Jupyter notebook should run without errors using Python 3.x

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Traditional Master's degrees come with increasingly exorbitant costs. Even after the current Covid-19 pandemic abates and traditional in-person, in-classroom instruction resumes, many college-age individuals will have to confront the question whether taking on potentially five or six-figure debt provides the appropriate long-term payoff. 

For this project I will perform the following analysis steps
1. From Stack Overflow survey data, determine 
    - ranges of data scientist starting salaries for cohorts with some college education or a bachelor's degree PLUS an online data science-specific training
    - ranges of data scientist starting salary for cohorts with a Master's Degree 
3. Compare these salary points with other public, credible sources
4. Use a consolidated view of these salary ranges as a starting point for a 20 year simplified income/net worth calculation
5. Determine which cohort would attain a higher 'ROI' based on this simplified model after 20 years


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 main notebook, 1 Python file containing utility functions, and 1 data file. Markdown cells are used extensively to facilitate walk throughs of the approach.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@bjorn.austraat/investing-in-your-education-is-a-masters-degree-in-data-science-worth-it-ff228521b804?sk=f539ff52e9188933fcbc1f55a52fbe56).
