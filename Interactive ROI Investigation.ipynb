    "Traditional college degrees come with increasingly exorbitant costs. Even after the current Covid-19 pandemic abates and traditional in-person, in-classroom instruction resumes, many college-age individuals will have to confront the question whether taking on potentially six-figure debt provides the appropriate long-term payoff. \n",

    "I will use the 2020 Stack Overflow survey data as a starting point to explore the question whether an aspiring data scientist is better off **from a highly simplified cashflow / ROI perspective** choosing a relatively shorter and much more inexpensive MOOC (Massive Open Online Classroom), self-guided and online-first education or should consider committing to a 4-6 year traditional degree with expected higher starting salary but corresponding debt burden and deferred earnings potential."
